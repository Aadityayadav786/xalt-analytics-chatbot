Data Analytics
While we talk about data is the next new oil, most of the data are in unstructured formats distributed in various forms over multiple mediums, these data sets are highly rich on information but the big challenge is to mine and analyze such unstructured data.
With stellar growth in cloud computing deep learning techniques, it is now possible to derive meaning out of these complex unstructured data using Machine learning tools and derive signals that can make a significant impact in business decisions and can also help in predicting future outcomes for both business & consumers.
We help our clients in filtering noise from such “unstructured data” of any forms such as ;
   Text Data : Recognize handwritten contents, scanned data, message data, text files, emails, numerical or textual log  data, web pages, any other business documents including social media data distributed in any form including extracting  information from emoticons
   Image Data : Identify moods and sentiment of individual or group of an individual by analyzing photographs and  images, gif files etc.
   Video Data : Analyze real-time or static video data by utilizing advanced algorithms thereby turning video files into actionable intelligence and insights
   Audio Data : Analyze audio files using Artificial Neural Networks and by classifying audio files such as mobile call data, call centre call records to decipher insights and improve on QA & QC
   What We Have Done in Data Analytics:
   1. Manufacturing : For electronic component manufacturing company, we did an elaborative data-driven EDA (Exploratory data analysis). The dataset was about the various defects in the products across each shit across each product. They were utilizing various methods to mitigate the defects. So the goal was to identify the defect distribution across each product across each operator and to answer various questions such as which method is best for reducing the defect. Which product get which type of defect? Which shift has effective working in terms of revenue generation for the company? What methods are efficient in reducing which defect? And many more business-related questions. We created a satisfactory EDA on the data set and answered all the logical questions in terms of visualization that are easy to understand and make decisions. We dashboard the result in a very interactive manner using plotly dash and google charts.
   2. Finance : For a financial institute We did a complete EDA (Exploratory data analysis) and ML modeling to understand the behavior of their customers. We did various analyses on the dataset to identify the probability of default. In which segment and what level of POD? We did data analysis to identify the customer churn pattern and the areas that can be improved that determine what type of customers are generating high revenue and what type of customers are probable to churn. This helped in reducing the overall NPA for the institute. We have also determined the customer life cycle value (predictive modeling) that helps in identifying which customer can generate what level of revenue for an institute. 
   3. Heathcare : We have done Exploratory Data Analysis on a Healthcare Dataset consisting of 151 attributes and built interactive dashboards. We build an overall health level prediction system, which will ask health-related questions from the user and then predict the overall health level of the user It will also provide tips to the user to improve their overall health level. For example, if a person's overall health level is poor, Then we will interpret what are the factors responsible for the poor health of the person and advice accordingly to improve the user's overall health level.

How does your company differentiate itself in the field of AI-driven analytics compared to global competitors? 
Xalt Analytics differentiates itself in the AI-driven analytics space through a blend of deep domain expertise, hands-on execution, and real-world impact. Founded by Dr. Nitin Agarwal, a PhD with 25+ years of global experience across institutions like SAS (USA) and IIM Indore, our leadership brings elite academic and practical pedigree.
Unlike many firms that focus only on theoretical models, we emphasize end-to-end analytics, from data engineering to model deployment—tailored to each client. Our proprietary solutions like the XAMR mobile system for smart meter reading, healthcare chatbots, and AI-powered anomaly detection platforms demonstrate applied AI at scale.
Moreover, we’ve worked across verticals—manufacturing, finance, healthcare, telecom, automotive, and more—solving hard business problems using customized NLP, computer vision, and deep learning systems. What truly sets us apart is our ability to handle unstructured, multi-modal data (text, image, audio, video) and turn it into real-time, business-critical intelligence—making us not just data scientists, but transformation partners.

What’s the long-term vision for your AI products in emerging markets?
Xalt Analytics envisions becoming a catalyst for digital transformation in emerging markets by democratizing access to cutting-edge AI technologies. Our long-term vision is to bridge the gap between AI innovation and practical implementation, especially for industries and regions where digital maturity is still evolving.
We aim to scale solutions like XAMR, our mobile-based AI-powered meter reading system, across utilities in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, helping local governments automate operations and improve efficiency. In healthcare, we plan to expand our chatbot and diagnostics automation tools to rural clinics and telemedicine platforms, reducing dependency on physical infrastructure.
Our approach focuses on creating lightweight, low-latency AI solutions that run efficiently on mobile and edge devices—making them ideal for bandwidth-constrained environments. We combine scalable machine learning with local language NLP to increase adoption and usability. Ultimately, our goal is to make AI a utility, not a luxury, for businesses and institutions in emerging economies.

What kind of machine learning models have you deployed for real-time analytics?
Based on the provided text, here are the machine learning models and applications mentioned in the context of real-time or near real-time analytics:
Specific Models Mentioned:
Fast R-CNN and SSD models: Used for vision-based fire and smoke detection, implying real-time monitoring.   
Faster R-CNN and YOLO models: Used to detect numbers in electronic meter readings from mobile camera images. This is part of the XAMR system/app, which is designed for swift, potentially offline (implying real-time on-device) processing.   
YOLO (along with template matching): Used for mailbox identification to check if an email is active or inactive.   
Applications Implying Real-Time Analytics (Models sometimes specified broadly):
Automatic Text Extraction/Sentiment Analysis: A dashboard was created to represent real-time sentiment from text using a trained sentiment model. This tool performed timely aspect-based sentiment analysis on real-time customer reviews.   
Vehicle Number Plate Recognition: A system was created to detect number plates from a live camera feed.   
Person Detection: An IoT system using real-time CCTV cameras monitors people entering/leaving buildings and counts people moving through areas using the Xtract application. Xtract itself is a platform leveraging deep learning.   
AI Trading System: A Deep Reinforcement Learning agent was developed for stock trading, which operates based on market data (implying real-time or near real-time decision-making).   
LegalQuery Assistant: This application uses RAG (Retrieve-and-Generate) architecture for a QA system, including follow-up questions with user state management and real-time document QA, implying real-time interaction and processing.   
Mobile Data Science: The capability to perform ML tasks like object detection, image classification, and NLP directly on mobile devices enables real-time processing without constant server reliance. The XAMR app is a prime example of this on-device processing.

How does your XAMR system handle analog vs digital meter readings?
The XAMR system is described as a solution for automating the capture of both analog and digital meter readings.   
It utilizes deep learning models integrated into a mobile application to streamline the image capture process for these readings.   
While the text mentions specific models like Faster R-CNN and YOLO being used for reading digital electronic meters, it does not specify the distinct techniques or models employed within the XAMR system to read or differentiate analog meter readings (e.g., dials).   

I read you worked with Live Intent. What problem did you solve for them?
For this client, Xalt Analytics analyzed customer data, performed data operations (like cleaning and munging) to make it usable, explored hidden insights, and created reports showing important business metrics based on the customer data

You mentioned AI use in healthcare—can you expand on how you handle patient data security?
Our company values privacy, and you can find our general Privacy Policy outlining our practices primarily for website interactions. However, the information available here doesn't detail the specific security measures, protocols, or compliance frameworks like HIPAA used to safeguard sensitive patient data within those healthcare projects.
